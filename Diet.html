      <h4>Understanding The Diet</h4>
        <p class="boxed">Three-toed box turtles are omnivorous, meaning they consume both plant material and animal matter. Their animal-based diet includes earthworms, crickets, insects, and occasionally specific types of fish. However, while they can eat animal protein, box turtles are primarily herbivorous, with a diet mainly consisting of fruits and vegetables.

            Calcium, an essential nutrient for their health, is not abundant in many fruits and vegetables. To ensure an adequate intake, calcium supplements, such as powder, or calcium-rich insects, should be incorporated into their diet.
            
            It is important to note that not all fruits and vegetables are suitable for box turtles. For instance, green cabbage is a highly nutritious option, while purple cabbage, although healthy, should be fed in moderation due to its goitrogen content, which can interfere with thyroid function and cause digestive upset.
            
            Always provide fresh, clean water daily to maintain hydration. It is essential to thoroughly research safe food options for your box turtle. Below, I have outlined some of the key foods that can contribute to a healthy diet for your pet.
